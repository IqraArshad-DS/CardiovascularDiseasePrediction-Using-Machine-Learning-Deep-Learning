# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **cardiovascular diseases** using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset contains features like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## 📊 Dataset Features
| **Feature Name**         | **Description**                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Age, Gender, Height      | Key demographic and physical attributes             |
| Systolic & Diastolic BP  | Blood pressure metrics for cardiovascular health    |
| Cholesterol, Glucose     | Levels indicating potential metabolic risks         |
| Smoking, Alcohol Intake  | Lifestyle factors that contribute to health risks   |
| Physical Activity        | Indicator of activity level                         |
